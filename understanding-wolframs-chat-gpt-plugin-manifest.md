# Understanding Wolfram's ChatGPT Plugin Manifest



### Background

I am fascinated by the simplicity of configuring a ChatGPT plugin. There is a lot of power packed into the lightweight [Plugin Manifest file as described in the documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/plugin-manifest). I am collecting examples of these plugin manifest as I find them on my [awesome  ChatGPT plugin](https://github.com/imaurer/awesome-chatgpt-plugins/) list.



I am most interested in the field `description_for_model` that comes with this description:

> Description better tailored to the model, such as token context length considerations or keyword usage for improved plugin prompting.



Be aware that the current character limit for this field is 8000 characters, but the documentation states this ***will decrease over time***.



Further down it says:

> When a user makes a query that might be a potential request that goes to a plugin, the model looks through the descriptions of the endpoints in the OpenAPI specification along with the `description_for_model` in the manifest file. Just like with prompting other language models, *you will want to test out multiple prompts and descriptions to see what works best.*



The documentation describes some [best practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/best-practices) which are helpful, but the [examples](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/examples) initially provided are too generic to be useful.



### Wolfram Manifest Breakdown

I copied the `description_for_model` from  [Wolfram plugin manifest](https://www.wolframalpha.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json) and asked ChatGPT to provide a line-by-line explaination of it by providing links to the Wolfram website and some additional context after re-outputting each line:

### Interesting Note

Clearly ChatGPT knows quite a bit about Wolfram's capabilities and natural language API. Building your own plugin with something less well understood by ChatGPT will likely run into challenges that may require more explanation and direction. 

You might also want to improve any public API documents so that ChatGPT 5 can read them.
